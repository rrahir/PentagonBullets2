/** An [[EntityCastingInfo]] gathers everything there is to know about an entity currently casting a spell. Namely, its
  * id, the ability currently casting, the time it started casting it, the position it was in when it started to cast
  * the ability.
  *
  * This will be used for at least (off the top of my head) two things:
  *   - allowing the server to know whether the caster moved, hence breaking the casting
  *   - allowing the server to know whether the spell finished casting
  *   - allowing the UI to display the entity casting its stuff.
